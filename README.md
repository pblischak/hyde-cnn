## Requirements

Below are the Python and R packages that were used for performing the analyses
in our paper. We used Python v3.7 and R v3.6.

**Python packages:**

The `environment.yml` has all of the specifications needed to recreate the conda
environment we used for simulating, training, and testing HyDe-CNN. If you just
want to install the essential packages, they are listed below:

 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - tensorflow
 - sklearn
 - tskit
 - msprime
 - pysam

**R packages:**

 - tidyverse
