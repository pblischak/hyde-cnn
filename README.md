# HyDe-CNN: Hybridization Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains worked examples of using deep learning models for hybridization
detection. 

More details can be found within each of the main folders:

 - **`model-selection/`**: Train a CNN classifier to distinguish among four different
   hybridization scenarios.
 - **`estimate-gamma/`**: (still in the works) Train a CNN regression model to estimate
   the hybridization parameter, gamma (0 < gamma < 1).
 - **`timing-gamma/`**: (still in the works) Train a CNN regression model to estimate
   both gamma and the time when the hybridization event occurred.

We hope to continue exploring different applications of CNNs for the analysis of hybridization
and will post them to this repo as we go.
