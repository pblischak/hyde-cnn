HyDe-CNN: Hybridization Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks
====================================================================

We used these four models to test (1) model selection, (2) estimation of the
hybridization parameter (gamma), and (3) estimation of gamma and the timing
of hybridization.

Neural networks with trained with Keras using a Tensorflow backend.
